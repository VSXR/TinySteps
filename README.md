# TINY STEPS REPO FORKED FROM THE ORIGINAL REPO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## About the Project

This is a repository for the Tiny Steps project, an application designed specifically for first-time parents. The app allows new parents to track their baby's daily habits, milestones, and development progress in an intuitive way. Parents can monitor feeding times, sleep patterns, growth measurements, and developmental achievements.

The application is built using the Django web framework, providing a robust and secure platform for this sensitive family data.
